00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.100
hello everybody we are the fine brothers

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.270
it is possible that some of you don't

3
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.560
know who we are but we are the founders

4
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.170
of FB we can say it together hi we're

5
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.849
the five brothers I don't know why we

6
00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.230
don't consider yourselves warned

7
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.480
anymore okay not gonna spoil things

8
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.219
except for this update video that has a

9
00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.630
lot of things that we're giving you an

10
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.520
update about so this is an update video

11
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.630
we're gonna have to be doing these a

12
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.640
little bit more as a channel like ours

13
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.810
that has so many different shows on it

14
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.250
there's changes that happen and it can

15
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.480
be confusing if we don't talk to you

16
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.859
guys so this is the first of probably

17
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.210
many whether it's our other team members

18
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.260
here that will be coming on to kind of

19
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.090
give you the general update but this is

20
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.329
about gaming yeah Gaming update so we've

21
00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.190
done a lot of updates about gaming over

22
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.570
time because it is the thing on the

23
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.879
channel that is uh that struggles the

24
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.440
most because only certain people like to

25
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.149
watch it on the channel and so even

26
00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.950
right now it's yet another update about

27
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.180
how we're having to change the way

28
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.700
gaming works on the react channel so

29
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.800
first of all the Tuesday game is the one

30
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.420
off games those aren't going anywhere

31
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.590
this is all about the Let's Plays

32
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.329
playing a game all the way through that

33
00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.370
we brought back several months ago after

34
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.590
a lot of clamor for it because we know

35
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.059
how much the people who watch that

36
00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.039
content probably are more obsessed with

37
00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.780
those videos in any other video that FB

38
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.670
even makes is the less play fans just

39
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.650
like as obsessed as we are here at the

40
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.390
company about them we love them a lot

41
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.670
but it's the struggle of not everybody

42
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.590
wants to watch those so here's reality

43
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.240
check time yeah so the reality is that

44
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.159
even in the other update videos we

45
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.020
talked about it the gaming episodes are

46
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.490
some of the most expensive things that

47
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.189
we produce with the amount of time that

48
00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.930
it takes to put them together and so

49
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.040
we've always been trying to figure out

50
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.420
well how do we get more people to watch

51
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.100
them and how do we make this work but

52
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.470
the time that goes into having all the

53
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.020
talented and the producer months

54
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.150
literally everything if you just aren't

55
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.740
there because that has happening we're

56
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.240
having to make a bit of a change because

57
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.829
it's not just impacting like the Let's

58
00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.820
Plays themselves it actually is

59
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.710
impacting the channel completely this is

60
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.600
the wonderful algorithm problems on

61
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.820
YouTube ongoing where if you end up

62
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.399
having a video on your channel or a show

63
00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.229
that we make that is getting less views

64
00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.110
then that makes all the other shows on a

65
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.060
channel also start to get less views as

66
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.950
well because it stops recommending the

67
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.020
videos out to you if you don't watch the

68
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.460
gaming episodes yeah that's why you

69
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.750
might realize if you stopped watching

70
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.280
one of your favorite youtubers for like

71
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.540
a week and then you'd like never get

72
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.649
recommended their video again because

73
00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.789
that's kind of the way the algorithm is

74
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.289
we are talking to YouTube about this

75
00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.790
they don't believe us all the time about

76
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.739
these things so the Let's Plays though

77
00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.490
are not complete

78
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.530
we know away forever they're just

79
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.960
leaving YouTube readapt we adapt and

80
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.160
change Roth what's happened to the Let's

81
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.240
Plays we're gonna be moving and

82
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.370
transitioning a lot of what we do when

83
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.320
it comes to gaming over to twitch we're

84
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.700
gonna be doing a lot of other things on

85
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.960
Twitch and I've already started playing

86
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.820
around with twitch and so this is

87
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.320
telling you all the different things

88
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.660
we're gonna be doing on Twitch and going

89
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.700
to twitch is to help make this more

90
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.040
sustainable because we're live we don't

91
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.210
have to worry as much about things like

92
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.100
the editing we're able to also do things

93
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.410
that we see comments about all the time

94
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.910
probably two most common comments from

95
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.770
the gaming fans are why aren't you

96
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.360
finishing this game a hell of a lot

97
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.280
faster and it's well it's just a year to

98
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.530
play a game correct yes and also a lot

99
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.550
of times we'll play a game and then

100
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.750
people will say that was awesome played

101
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.390
with another generation but it's not

102
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.190
gonna work right so this is gonna kind

103
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.110
of kill two birds with one stone as they

104
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.790
say make it more sustainable to produce

105
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.960
and also be able to do both of those

106
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.000
things on Twitch and more easy way and

107
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.170
even we'll talk about a little later

108
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.630
which is that the hope is because the

109
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.330
money on YouTube with D monetization and

110
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.070
all the problems with the views twitch

111
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.960
is hopefully a different solution that

112
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.520
allows you guys to help support the show

113
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.010
more to help us continue to make it with

114
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.690
subscribing and donating and things like

115
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.180
that so let's roll through specifically

116
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.710
like yeah what is the transition going

117
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.860
to be from the Let's Plays on YouTube to

118
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.080
now all this content on Twitch so first

119
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.630
is that with until dawn that is going to

120
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.150
wrap up tomorrow last let's play upload

121
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.710
tomorrow on the react channel

122
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.570
Benny is gonna cry bet he's a crier I

123
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.800
don't know if you know that it's a very

124
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.080
gonna try not to cry yet I've not but if

125
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.310
I was gonna say it's a known thing but I

126
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.510
think it's only known to the people who

127
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.130
work here that I cry out so tomorrow

128
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.750
until dawn is finishing on the channel

129
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.830
and then next week on Thursday is going

130
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.390
to be bringing Tom Tori and Scott who

131
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.770
have been playing until dawn this whole

132
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.080
time they're going to be completing the

133
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.520
until dawn experience live on Twitch

134
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.350
with the VR prequel and that's going to

135
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.360
be next week on Thursday that you'll be

136
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.710
able to do that so if you want to see

137
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.630
the last until dawn with those people

138
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.430
you're gonna have to go to twitch see

139
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.690
that's how we're trying to get you to go

140
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.660
over there we're not you have to go so

141
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.880
next is that the two games everybody's

142
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.709
been asking for the most over the past

143
00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.080
while it's doki-doki literature Club and

144
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.770
dream daddy

145
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.690
so first week of April we're gonna start

146
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.640
playing those yes but it'll be doki-doki

147
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.979
first then dream daddy but that's going

148
00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.720
to be multi-generational it's going to

149
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.840
be

150
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.000
multiple our streams again getting

151
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.860
through these games substantially faster

152
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.330
potentially in just two to three weeks

153
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.060
and that for us that's always been that

154
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.070
extra layering of what we can do here

155
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.720
with having so many generations I think

156
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.130
it'll be really interesting to watch

157
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.110
every week as they're progressing

158
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.490
through the game what are the different

159
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.810
choices and the different things that

160
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.240
the teens are experiencing and thinking

161
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.190
versus the elders and you can watch that

162
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.960
week by week now which is cool we're

163
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.090
hoping a few weeks after we launch Let's

164
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.410
Plays on Twitch to actually start doing

165
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.419
weekly generational gaming tournaments

166
00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:58.919
but what we've always wanted to do but

167
00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.479
have not really been able to do on

168
00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.220
YouTube is have the generational

169
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.360
tournaments all in the same game

170
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.740
multiple weeks like each week a

171
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.300
different generation then the winners of

172
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.100
each play in the grand react

173
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.200
generational championship tournament

174
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.850
very moderate it's very important

175
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.320
there's talk of that becoming a Sunday

176
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.540
stream so that's coming but that's still

177
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.790
not all because as we continue to grow

178
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.740
in hopeful success of this initiative on

179
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.479
Twitch we also want to kind of look at

180
00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.830
the shows that are very popular on

181
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.150
YouTube that everyone loves to play

182
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.350
along with and figure out the live

183
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.850
version of that so we're talking about

184
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.740
things like guess that song or try not

185
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.090
to laugh and trying to do those things

186
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.370
not just live but also with you guys in

187
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.440
the chat playing along or sending things

188
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.539
as we're going to try to stop everybody

189
00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:37.770
I think we're trying to figure out of

190
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.990
like some of these shows might work well

191
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.930
to be an hour long two-hour long live

192
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.970
version of it and they're very engaging

193
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.500
with you guys and have fun in that way

194
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.240
but it also could be that we have some

195
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.320
things that are showing almost behind

196
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.180
the scenes of right doing these things

197
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.860
like challenge chalice is a good example

198
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.330
of like we could kind of maybe show that

199
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.639
while we're filming or you can just

200
00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.620
watch the filming of a teens react we're

201
00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.669
trying to figure out all these different

202
00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.320
things that you guys can help us figure

203
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.789
out what do you like what do you don't

204
00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.650
so all of that wasn't enough to get you

205
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.669
to follow us over on Twitch and

206
00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:06.660
subscribe and donate if you're able to

207
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.010
help support and make us be able to keep

208
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.810
making all this stuff the community team

209
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.919
is gonna still be streaming over there

210
00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.330
they've been streaming there for a while

211
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.590
now they're gonna be hanging out playing

212
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.030
games all the time so there's gonna be

213
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.220
streams constantly but including Tom and

214
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.810
Eric streaming on Tuesdays and fortnight

215
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.160
Fridays with Tori so that's gonna be

216
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.479
going all the time it's gonna be streams

217
00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.340
multiple hours basically every single

218
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.380
day which is pretty awesome so to kind

219
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.930
of wrap up this whole update video is

220
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.940
that we're having to figure out how to

221
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.090
evolve as an experiment yeah and that

222
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.820
the reality of it is for the company

223
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.310
overall is that we're making like 20

224
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.289
videos a week now you guys are loving

225
00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.400
the watcher we're loving

226
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.710
but it's a struggle to figure out how to

227
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.110
actually make enough money to keep

228
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.699
producing those especially when you have

229
00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:48.930
a team as large as this team has become

230
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.150
and so that's where you end up in a

231
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.610
situation from YouTube D monetizing and

232
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.930
YouTube not serving the videos out to

233
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.389
the fans you have to start bringing the

234
00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:58.860
content on YouTube and it makes a very

235
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.139
little bit amount of money then you end

236
00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.610
up on Facebook and you make a little bit

237
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.900
of money and now you're trying to go

238
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.979
over to twitch to try to make a little

239
00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.419
bit of money because it just hasn't the

240
00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:09.570
industry hasn't matured yet where the

241
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.490
things like advertising just pays for it

242
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.169
all and that's why you'll see us or some

243
00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.370
other channels end up with things like

244
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.169
subscribe on Twitch donate on Twitch

245
00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.669
even though it feels like but you have

246
00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.050
this huge YouTube channel what do you

247
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.460
need that for and it is the reality that

248
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.050
the team that is here is producing so

249
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.090
much content we can't do some of these

250
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.199
things unless we have some of that

251
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.270
support so if you are able to subscribe

252
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.520

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.320
can do to support FBE there's of course

254
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.210

258
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.870
